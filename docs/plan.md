# Project Plan

This page outlines the plan for developing the documentation viewer, detailing the goals, milestones, and next steps.

## Project Overview

The documentation viewer is a simple, user-friendly interface to read and navigate markdown documentation files hosted within the same GitHub repository. This project aims to make internal documentation more accessible and easy to navigate for both new and existing users.

## Goals

- **Short-term Goal**: Create a minimal viable product (MVP) to display markdown files with a sidebar and content section.
- **Medium-term Goal**: Add search functionality, improve UI design, and allow more interactive features (like editing content directly).
- **Long-term Goal**: Enable integration with other repositories or allow users to contribute content to the documentation.

## Milestones

1. **Phase 1: Initial Setup** (Completed)
   - Repository created
   - Basic layout with sidebar and content area
   - First markdown files added
2. **Phase 2: UI Improvements** (In Progress)
   - Improve UI design using custom styles
   - Add more markdown files for additional documentation
3. **Phase 3: Search Functionality** (Upcoming)
   - Implement search to find specific documentation topics
4. **Phase 4: Community Contributions** (Future)
   - Set up pull request guidelines for contributors
   - Add options for editing and submitting new documentation

## Next Steps

- Finalize the UI design and test the functionality.
- Add additional markdown documentation files.
- Plan future improvements based on user feedback.
